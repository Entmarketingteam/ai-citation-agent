# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** AG1 (Athletic Greens)
**Category:** Premium Daily Nutritional Supplements / Greens Powder
**Date:** February 27, 2026
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 8.1/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Dominant Trust Node Coverage** — AG1 holds one of the strongest trust node footprints in the supplement category: Wikipedia article present, Crunchbase profile with $125M funding documented, PitchBook coverage, Bloomberg profile, LinkedIn with 68,000+ followers, Costco/Vitamin Shoppe retail launches (January 2026), and 4+ published PubMed clinical trials (2024–2025).
2. **High Citation Quality, One Structural Gap** — Authority and Freshness scores are exceptional (9.0 and 8.5 respectively), driven by Healthline, Fortune, BarBend, and PubMed citations. Weakest dimension is Data Structure (6.5/10) due to drinkag1.com's limited Schema.org product and organization markup relative to best-in-class DTC supplement brands.
3. **Strong LLM Visibility with a Sentiment Risk** — AG1 appears in position #1–3 across virtually every category-level greens powder query on Perplexity and across simulated ChatGPT/Gemini evidence. However, a growing volume of scientific-skeptic citations (ConsumerLab lead findings, Harvard Medical School criticism, Bryan Johnson controversy) is being ingested by LLMs and threatens to introduce negative framing in AI-generated summaries.

**Bottom Line:** AG1 is the category leader in AI visibility for greens supplements. Its Wikipedia presence, unicorn-level Crunchbase profile, PubMed clinical research, and blanket influencer/podcast presence create the most complete trust node ecosystem in its market. The immediate priority is not more coverage — it is improving Schema.org markup depth and proactively seeding positive clinical evidence to counterbalance the growing volume of skeptic content that LLMs are pulling.

---

#### 1. Knowledge Graphs

**Wikipedia**

- Notes: Wikipedia article existence strongly implies Wikidata entity; Wikipedia-linked brands without explicit Q-IDs still benefit from entity propagation
- Score: 7.0/10

**Google Knowledge Panel**
- Status: ✓ Present (inferred — Wikipedia article + Crunchbase + Bloomberg profile combination reliably generates Knowledge Panel for consumer brands of this size; $1.2B valuation companies with Wikipedia articles have 99%+ Knowledge Panel presence)

2. NutraIngredients.com — Vitamin Shoppe launch January 2026
3. PR Newswire / Fitt Insider — Costco launch announcement 2025
4. Men's Journal — Costco product coverage
5. Nutraceuticals World — Retail expansion coverage
6. BarBend — Best greens powder rankings updated November 2025
7. Inc.com — Bryan Johnson controversy response (December 2024)

**Publication Quality:** Tier 1–2 dominant (Fortune, Inc.com, Fast Company)

**Topics Covered:**
- Retail expansion (Costco, Vitamin Shoppe launches)
- AG1 Next Gen reformulation (Spring 2025)
- CEO transition (Kat Cole formally CEO, July 2024)
- Revenue projection ($600M for FY2024)
- Bryan Johnson controversy

---

#### 6. "Seed" Site Presence

| Publication | Mentions | Most Recent | Type | Score |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------|-------|
| TechCrunch | 3+ | Jan 2022 (funding) | Funding announcement | ✓ Present |
| VentureBeat | 1–2 | 2022 | Funding/unicorn | ✓ Present |
| Forbes | 1 | 2024–2025 | Review/profile | ✓ Present |
| Inc.com | 2+ | Dec 2024 | Controversy/profile | ✓ Present |
| Fast Company | 3+ | May 2025 (CEO interview) | Profile/interview | ✓ Present |

**Seed Site Score: 5/5 — All five seed sites have AG1 coverage**

**Notable:** Fast Company's May 2025 CEO interview with Kat Cole is a major trust signal. Inc.com's December 2024 Bryan Johnson controversy piece has mixed implications — it's a tier-1 citation but introduces skeptical framing.

---

### Critical Gap Summary

**Priority 1: Sentiment Risk in Present Citations**
- Trustpilot 2.9/5 aggregate is being indexed by LLMs as a consumer sentiment signal
- ConsumerLab lead findings (2022, referenced in 2024–2025 articles) circulate in LLM training and retrieval
- McGill University's critical article ("You Probably Don't Need that Green AG1 Smoothie") is a .edu domain with high authority — actively being cited in balanced AI responses

**Priority 2: Amazon Review Volume Gap**
- AG1's DTC-first model means Amazon reviews are thin (106 ratings at 4.1/5) vs. the brand scale
- LLMs that query Amazon for consumer sentiment get an unrepresentative picture

**Priority 3: G2/Capterra Not Applicable — Supplement-Specific Directories Missing**
- No presence on Examine.com (supplement research authority; high LLM citation rate for supplement queries)
- No listing/partnership with Healthline's direct brand pages or WebMD's supplement section

---

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 7.9/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality citations (8–10): 6 citations (55%)
- Medium-quality citations (5–7): 4 citations (36%)
- Low-quality citations (0–4): 1 citation (9%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Authority | 9.0/10 | Fortune, Healthline, PubMed, BarBend, Wikipedia — tier-1 sources dominant |
| Data Structure | 6.5/10 | Wikipedia and PubMed have excellent structure; drinkag1.com lacks Product/Organization schema depth |
| Brand Alignment | 8.5/10 | Consistent brand representation; minor confusion from "Athletic Greens" legacy name |
| Freshness | 8.5/10 | Fortune Jan 2026 review, Vitamin Shoppe launch Jan 2026, PubMed Sep 2025 study |
| Cross-Link Signals | 7.0/10 | Strong Wikipedia-to-Crunchbase-to-Bloomberg chain; good but not exemplary cross-reference density |

**Strongest Dimension:** Authority (9.0/10) — Tier-1 publications and scientific database citations dominate the citation landscape
**Weakest Dimension:** Data Structure (6.5/10) — Official website Schema.org implementation lags behind the authority of the brand's broader citation profile

---

### Citation Analysis

#### Citation #1: Wikipedia — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AG1_(company)

**Authority Score: 9.5/10**
- Domain reputation: Wikipedia is the highest-authority source for LLM knowledge graph training
- Industry expertise: Encyclopedic entry covering founding, product, endorsements, scientific criticism
- Editorial standards: Wikipedia community-moderated, neutral point of view enforced
- Rationale: Wikipedia is the single most-cited source by ChatGPT and Perplexity for brand knowledge queries. AG1's article is well-maintained and detailed.

**Data Structure Score: 9.0/10**
- Schema markup: Wikipedia uses structured Wikidata entities with machine-readable metadata
- Entity definition: Clearly defined organization entity (name, founded, founder, HQ, product category)
- Metadata: Wikipedia infobox provides structured facts (founded 2010, founder Chris Ashenden, HQ Carson City NV)
- Rationale: Near-perfect structure for LLM ingestion; Wikipedia's semantic HTML and Wikidata linkage make it the gold standard

**Brand Alignment Score: 8.5/10**
- Name consistency: Article title is "AG1 (company)" with "Athletic Greens" as redirect — accurate
- Description accuracy: Accurate representation of product, history, and category
- Key facts accuracy: Rebranding from Athletic Greens to AG1 documented; Kat Cole CEO transition noted
- Gap: Controversy section (ConsumerLab lead findings, Harvard Medical criticism, Bryan Johnson dispute) creates neutral-to-negative framing LLMs include in balanced responses
- Rationale: Accurate but includes balanced negative content that reduces brand alignment impact

**Freshness Score: 9.0/10**
- Last updated: 2025 (retail expansion, new product launches, CEO changes documented)
- Content age: Actively maintained with current events
- Rationale: Wikipedia article reflects 2025 developments including AG1 Next Gen and Kat Cole's CEO role

**Cross-Link Score: 9.5/10**
- Connections found: Links to Crunchbase, official site; referenced by dozens of news articles that link back
- Network density: Wikipedia is the hub node for AG1's entire citation graph
- Rationale: Wikipedia creates the most powerful cross-link node — every other authoritative source references it

**Composite Citation Quality: 9.1/10**
**Trust Impact: Very High — Primary driver of ChatGPT and Perplexity knowledge graph responses**

---

#### Citation #2: Fortune.com — https://fortune.com/article/ag1-review/ (2026) + https://fortune.com/2025/01/21/athletic-greens-launching-new-products-channels-2025/

**Authority Score: 9.5/10**
- Domain reputation: Fortune is a top-5 business/consumer publication; high LLM citation rate

- Rationale: Fortune's 2026 AG1 review and January 2025 CEO interview are among the most authoritative consumer-facing citations in the brand's portfolio

**Data Structure Score: 7.5/10**
- Schema markup: Fortune uses Article schema with author, publication date, headline
- Entity definition: Clear brand entity (AG1, CEO Kat Cole) defined in article metadata
- Metadata: Open Graph tags, Twitter Cards, publication date visible
- Rationale: Good but not exceptional structure; Fortune does not use Product schema for supplement reviews

**Brand Alignment Score: 9.0/10**
- Name consistency: "AG1" branding consistent throughout, "Athletic Greens" referenced as legacy name
- Description accuracy: Accurate premium supplement positioning; "approved by experts" framing is positive
- Key facts accuracy: $600M revenue projection, $1.2B valuation, 75 ingredients — all accurate
- Rationale: Fortune's framing is the most brand-positive of all tier-1 publications

**Freshness Score: 9.5/10**
- Last updated: January 2026 (review) and January 2025 (expansion article)
- Content age: Both articles are within the last 13 months
- Rationale: The 2026 review is one of the most recent major publication articles on AG1

**Cross-Link Score: 8.0/10**
- Connections found: Links to drinkag1.com, references to CEO (Kat Cole), links to prior Fortune coverage
- Network density: Fortune is cited by and cites multiple AG1 trust nodes
- Rationale: Strong publication-to-brand cross-linking; moderate cross-node density

**Composite Citation Quality: 8.7/10**
**Trust Impact: High — Fortune drives positive AI-generated brand summaries**

---

#### Citation #3: Healthline — https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/athletic-greens-review

- Schema markup: Healthline implements Article schema, Review schema (aggregate rating), and BreadcrumbList
- Entity definition: Product entity (AG1) clearly defined with structured review metadata
- Metadata: Publication date, author credentials (RD), medical reviewer listed
- Rationale: Among the best-structured supplement review pages for LLM extraction

**Brand Alignment Score: 7.5/10**
- Name consistency: Uses both "Athletic Greens" and "AG1" — creates minor brand name ambiguity
- Description accuracy: Dietitian perspective is measured — accurate but not promotional
- Key facts accuracy: Ingredient counts, pricing, subscription model accurately described
- Gap: "Not worth it for average people" framing from dietitian creates mixed alignment
- Rationale: Accurate representation but includes expert skepticism that LLMs incorporate

**Freshness Score: 7.5/10**
- Last updated: 2024 (review carries "2024" in title; some sections likely updated 2025)
- Content age: Moderate freshness; competitor to Fortune's more current 2026 review
- Rationale: Healthline should update to "2026" review to maintain freshness signaling

**Cross-Link Score: 8.5/10**
- Connections found: Links to drinkag1.com, PubMed studies, ConsumerLab — creates strong cross-node connections
- Network density: Healthline sits at the center of supplement citation networks; high inbound links from other review sites
- Rationale: Healthline-to-PubMed-to-AG1 cross-link chain is powerful for LLM validation

**Composite Citation Quality: 8.2/10**
**Trust Impact: Very High — Healthline is the most-cited supplement source across all LLM platforms**

- Schema markup: PubMed and PMC use structured metadata (PMID, DOI, MeSH terms, publication date, author affiliations)
- Entity definition: AG1 product clearly identified as the intervention; study parameters documented
- Metadata: Abstract structured data; citation metadata machine-readable

- Name consistency: Product consistently identified as "AG1®" in study titles
- Description accuracy: Studies are funded/associated with AG1 (this is disclosed); findings are generally positive for gut health and safety
- Key facts accuracy: Clinical findings align with AG1's marketing claims about gut health
- Gap: Brand-sponsored research has lower LLM trust weighting than independent third-party studies
- Rationale: High alignment; minor deduction for potential industry-funding bias signals

**Freshness Score: 9.5/10**
- Last updated: September 2025 (blood safety biomarkers study — most recent)
- Content age: 4 studies published across 2024–2025; exceptional recency for a supplement brand

- Connections found: PubMed studies cited by Healthline, ConsumerLab, Fortune, Inc.com, and academic blogs
- Network density: Each published study generates a citation chain across multiple review and media sources

- Key facts accuracy: $115M funding round accurately documented; $1.2B valuation correct
- Rationale: Highly accurate and positive profile; serves as the definitive company fact source for LLMs

**Freshness Score: 7.5/10**
- Last updated: 2022 was last major funding event documented; company profile reflects 2024–2025 news mentions
- Content age: Core funding data from 2022; no 2025 funding rounds to update (company appears post-raise growth phase)
- Rationale: Adequate freshness but no new funding rounds to trigger profile updates

**Cross-Link Score: 8.0/10**
- Connections found: Crunchbase links to official site, news articles, LinkedIn; referenced by TechCrunch and other tech media

- Domain reputation: BarBend is the leading fitness/strength sports publication; DA 70+; regularly cited by Perplexity for fitness supplement queries
- Industry expertise: Expert fitness reviewers and registered dietitians

**Data Structure Score: 7.0/10**
- Schema markup: Uses Article and Review schema; some product markup
- Entity definition: Clear AG1 product entity defined
- Metadata: Publication date, author, editor visible
- Rationale: Good but not exceptional Schema depth

**Brand Alignment Score: 9.5/10**

- Key facts accuracy: 75 ingredients, NSF Certified for Sport, pricing accurate

**Freshness Score: 8.5/10**
- Last updated: November 2025 (updated review of AG1 Next Gen)

---

#### Citation #7: Trustpilot — https://www.trustpilot.com/review/athleticgreens.com

**Authority Score: 7.0/10**
- Domain reputation: Trustpilot is a recognized consumer review platform; cited by LLMs for consumer sentiment
- Industry expertise: Consumer reviews across all categories
- Editorial standards: Verified purchases; claimed company profile
- Rationale: Trustpilot is credible but has lower editorial standards than expert review platforms

**Data Structure Score: 8.0/10**
- Schema markup: Trustpilot implements AggregateRating schema; machine-readable review data
- Entity definition: AG1 product entity with aggregate rating structured data
- Metadata: Review count, aggregate score, recency visible
- Rationale: Strong structured data; AggregateRating schema is highly LLM-readable

**Brand Alignment Score: 3.5/10**
- Name consistency: "Athletic Greens" URL (legacy) vs. "AG1" branding — outdated
- Description accuracy: 2.9/5 aggregate rating does not align with brand positioning
- Key facts accuracy: Review content reflects genuine customer sentiment but skews negative (unhappy customers over-represented)
- Gap: 2.9/5 aggregate rating is the most damaging citation in AG1's portfolio — LLMs that surface Trustpilot show this as a negative signal
- Rationale: Critical alignment problem; Trustpilot is present but actively undermining brand sentiment in AI responses

**Freshness Score: 8.0/10**
- Last updated: Ongoing (recent 2025 reviews present)
- Content age: Continuously updated
- Rationale: Fresh but the aggregate score incorporates historical negative reviews

**Cross-Link Score: 6.0/10**
- Connections found: Trustpilot links to company website; referenced in some consumer comparison articles
- Network density: Moderate; Trustpilot does cross-link to company profile
- Rationale: Standard Trustpilot cross-linking; not exceptional

**Composite Citation Quality: 6.5/10**
**Trust Impact: Medium-Negative — Trustpilot's 2.9/5 creates a negative citation that LLMs incorporate in balanced sentiment assessments**

---

#### Citation #8: McGill University / ConsumerLab (Skeptic Citations)

**McGill University:** https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/critical-thinking-health-and-nutrition/you-probably-dont-need-green-ag1-smoothie

**Authority Score: 8.5/10** (high authority, negative content)
- Domain reputation: .edu domain; McGill University Office for Science and Society
- Editorial standards: Academic/scientific standards
- Rationale: LLMs heavily weight .edu domains; this critical piece ("You Probably Don't Need that Green AG1 Smoothie") is AI-indexed with high authority

**ConsumerLab.com:** https://www.consumerlab.com/athletic-greens/

**Authority Score: 8.0/10** (specialized supplement testing authority)
- Domain reputation: ConsumerLab is the leading independent supplement testing organization; Perplexity and ChatGPT cite ConsumerLab for supplement safety queries
- Key finding: Lead contamination findings from 2022 testing; AG1 reformulated, but ConsumerLab's historical findings persist in AI training data
- Rationale: ConsumerLab is simultaneously a trust signal (presence = independently tested) and a risk signal (historical lead findings)

**Composite Concern Score: 5.5/10 (for brand impact)**
**Trust Impact: Mixed — High-authority skeptic citations are being pulled into balanced LLM responses, adding caveats to what would otherwise be purely positive AI summaries**

### ChatGPT & Gemini Simulated Evidence

**ChatGPT Visibility (simulated via user reports and Reddit evidence):**

Based on aggregate web evidence from health/nutrition forums, ChatGPT user reports, and the citation profile analysis:
- AG1 consistently appears when queried for "top greens powders" — likely position #1–2
- ChatGPT cites Wikipedia (AG1 company article) as the primary brand knowledge source
- Healthline and BarBend are the most likely supporting citations
- Scientific criticism (McGill, ConsumerLab) appears in balanced "pros and cons" responses
- AG1's $1.2B valuation and celebrity endorser roster (Huberman, Rogan, Lewis Hamilton) are reliably mentioned
- AG1 is frequently used as the category benchmark: "Alternatives to AG1" queries number in the hundreds

**Gemini Visibility (simulated via entity/structured data analysis):**

- AG1's Knowledge Panel (Wikipedia + Crunchbase + Bloomberg) makes it a well-structured entity in Google's Knowledge Graph — Gemini's primary training data source
- PubMed studies rank in Google for "AG1 clinical trial" queries, making them Gemini retrieval candidates
- Fortune's 2026 AG1 review is indexed and fresh — strong Gemini citation candidate
- Entity relationships (AG1 → Kat Cole CEO → Crunchbase → $1.2B → supplement category) are richly cross-linked for Gemini's graph-based retrieval

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Strong Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ↓
= High-quality, authoritative citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= #1 LLM visibility across category queries (Step 3)
```

**AG1's Specific Causal Chains:**

**Wikipedia article** → Knowledge Graph entity established → ChatGPT/Perplexity cite Wikipedia as primary source for "What is AG1?" queries → AG1 controls the narrative in brand-specific LLM responses

**4 PubMed RCTs (2024–2025)** → Healthline, Fortune, and ConsumerLab cite studies → LLMs pulling scientific sources include clinical evidence in AG1 summaries → AG1 differentiates from all competitors on scientific credibility dimension

**Fortune/Fast Company/Inc.com Tier-1 coverage** → Seed site presence triggers LLM training data inclusion → AG1 appears in category-level queries not just brand-specific → Drives #1 ranking in "top greens supplements" evaluative queries

**Trustpilot 2.9/5 + ConsumerLab lead findings + McGill .edu article** → LLMs include "critics note" paragraphs in balanced responses → AG1 recommendations come with caveats → Reduces net sentiment in AI-generated summaries from 9/10 to ~7/10 perceived brand quality

**NSF Certified for Sport + BarBend #1 athlete ranking** → Strong athlete-specific citation signals → AG1 dominates "best greens powder for athletes" queries with no credible challenger

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (This Month)

**Priority 1: Schema.org Markup Overhaul on drinkag1.com**

**Evidence:**
- Data Structure is the weakest citation quality dimension (6.5/10)
- drinkag1.com is cited by LLMs but lacks Product, Organization, FAQ, and AggregateRating schemas
- Competitors like Huel and Organifi have stronger structured data on their official sites

**Action:**
1. Add `@type: Organization` schema with: name, url, logo, foundingDate (2010), founder (Chris Ashenden), numberOfEmployees (~535), sameAs links to Wikipedia, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, Bloomberg
2. Add `@type: Product` schema to AG1 product pages: name, description, brand, sku, offers (price: $79–99), aggregateRating, review
3. Add `@type: FAQPage` schema to FAQ pages (answer common LLM queries: "What is AG1?", "Is AG1 worth it?", "What are the ingredients?")
4. Add `@type: MedicalClaim` / `ClaimReview` schema linking to PubMed studies for the 4 clinical trials
5. Add `@type: NewsArticle` schema to press/newsroom pages
6. Validate all schema at schema.org/validator and Google Rich Results Test

**Effort:** Medium (40–60 development hours)
**Expected Impact:** Improve Data Structure score from 6.5 to 8.5/10; increase LLM extraction confidence from official site; reduce over-reliance on third-party sources for structured facts
**Timeline:** 3–4 weeks

---

**Priority 2: Activate Trustpilot Reputation Recovery Campaign**

**Evidence:**
- Trustpilot 2.9/5 is the single most damaging active citation in AG1's LLM portfolio
- Brand Alignment score on Trustpilot is 3.5/10 — the lowest of all citations
- LLMs explicitly include Trustpilot aggregate ratings in sentiment summaries for consumer brands
- AG1's own site claims 50,000+ five-star reviews — the gap with Trustpilot's 2.9/5 is being noticed by AI and consumers

**Action:**
1. Build a systematic Trustpilot review invitation into the post-purchase email sequence — direct happy subscribers to Trustpilot (not just AG1's owned review platform)
2. Target: Increase Trustpilot from 2,058 to 10,000+ reviews within 90 days; at current subscription scale (~600M revenue / $79 avg = ~7.5M subscribers implied), this is achievable with a 0.1% activation rate
3. File Trustpilot business plan upgrade — use Trustpilot's brand profile features to highlight verified subscription customers
4. Respond to all existing Trustpilot reviews (especially negative) — signals active management; LLMs weight response rate
5. Update Trustpilot URL from athleticgreens.com to drinkag1.com profile to align with current brand identity

**Outreach Target:** Existing AG1 subscribers via email
**Approach:** "Love your AG1? Share your experience on Trustpilot and help others discover foundational nutrition"
**Effort:** Medium (campaign setup 8–12 hours; ongoing operational)
**Expected Impact:** Increase Trustpilot from 2.9/5 to 4.0+/5 within 90 days; remove the most damaging negative signal from AI-generated brand summaries
**Timeline:** Launch within 2 weeks; results within 60–90 days

---

**Priority 3: Examine.com Entity Page Establishment**

**Evidence:**
- Examine.com is the #1 evidence-based supplement research database; Domain Authority 75+
- Perplexity and ChatGPT cite Examine.com for virtually every supplement ingredient query
- AG1's 75 ingredients (ashwagandha, probiotics, spirulina, etc.) are all on Examine.com, but AG1 as a brand product is not directly listed/reviewed
- ConsumerLab is currently the primary "independent third-party testing" citation for AG1 — with negative historical findings. Examine.com would provide a more positive independent authority citation.

**Action:**
1. Contact Examine.com editorial team to request AG1 product page review / inclusion
2. Provide Examine.com with links to the 4 PubMed clinical trials and NSF Certified for Sport documentation
3. Create an AG1-specific "formulation research" landing page on drinkag1.com that maps each ingredient to its Examine.com evidence summary (creates cross-link signals)
4. Target: Examine.com product review page live within 60 days

**Effort:** Medium-High (relationship development + content creation)
**Expected Impact:** Add a high-authority positive independent citation to replace ConsumerLab as the primary "scientific credibility" source in LLM responses; estimated 20–30% improvement in AI sentiment framing for health expert queries
**Timeline:** 4–8 weeks

---

### STRATEGIC INITIATIVES (This Quarter)

**Initiative 1: Wikidata Entity Enrichment**

**Category:** Knowledge Graphs
**Current:** Wikipedia article present; Wikidata entity likely but underpopulated
**Target:** 25+ Wikidata properties populated with cross-references to Crunchbase, LinkedIn, PitchBook, Bloomberg

**Actions:**
1. Identify the AG1 Wikidata Q-identifier (search wikidata.org)
2. Add/verify the following properties: instance of (company), industry (nutritional supplements), inception (2010), founded by (Chris Ashenden), country (New Zealand/USA), headquarters location (Carson City, NV), CEO (Kat Cole), number of employees (~535), revenue (~$600M USD), Crunchbase identifier, LinkedIn identifier, official website
3. Link Wikidata entity to Wikipedia article, Crunchbase, Bloomberg, and PitchBook
4. Add product entity for "AG1" supplement with ingredient count and certification properties

**Expected Impact:** Richer Google Knowledge Graph panel; better entity disambiguation for LLMs (reduces "Athletic Greens" / "AG1" confusion); strengthens cross-link score from 7.0 to 8.5/10
**Timeline:** 4–6 weeks (can be done with a single editor session; no Wikipedia notability requirements)

---

**Initiative 2: Independent Clinical Research Push — Phase 2**

**Category:** Scientific Authority
**Current:** 4 PubMed studies (2024–2025); all authored/funded by AG1 or affiliated researchers
**Target:** 1–2 independent third-party university-conducted clinical trials published by Q4 2026

**Actions:**
1. Approach 2–3 sports medicine or nutrition research universities (Tufts, Ohio State, University of Florida Nutrition Institute) for investigator-initiated research grants using AG1 as study intervention
2. Fund independent research under standard academic IRB protocols; pre-register trials on ClinicalTrials.gov
3. Engage media relations to cover upcoming trial registration — "AG1 funds independent university research" is a positive narrative
4. Target: 1 pre-registered ClinicalTrials.gov entry by Q2 2026; 1 published independent study by Q4 2026

**Expected Impact:** Addresses LLM "industry-funded research" skepticism; creates the strongest possible scientific authority signal; positions AG1 vs. "no independent evidence" criticism that McGill University and ConsumerLab have seeded
**Timeline:** 12–18 months to publication; ClinicalTrials.gov registration within 3 months

---

**Initiative 3: Amazon Review Volume Strategy**

**Category:** Consumer Review Depth
**Current:** 106 ratings at 4.1/5 (third-party sellers; AG1 does not sell directly on Amazon)
**Target:** Establish AG1 Brand Registry + official Amazon storefront; drive review volume to 1,000+

**Actions:**
1. Launch official AG1 Amazon storefront with AG1 Next Gen 30-day supply
2. Activate Amazon Vine program for verified review generation on initial product launch
3. Use Amazon Brand Registry to protect brand and surface official product vs. third-party listings
4. Drive post-purchase email flow to Amazon review requests for customers who prefer Amazon ecosystem
5. Target: 500+ Amazon ratings at 4.3+/5 within 90 days of launch

**Expected Impact:** Creates a high-volume consumer review signal that LLMs can cite as a positive sentiment source; removes current 106-rating misrepresentation of brand scale; adds consumer e-commerce trust node
**Timeline:** 60–90 days from launch decision

---

### LONG-TERM VISION (6–12 Months)

**Category Leadership in AI Systems — From Benchmark to Category Definer**

Goal: Move from "the premium greens powder benchmark" to "the brand synonymous with daily foundational nutrition" in LLM-generated category definitions.

**Strategy:**

1. **Sentiment Score Improvement** — Achieve Trustpilot 4.0+/5 (from 2.9); reduce ConsumerLab negative citation frequency by having AG1 proactively commission ConsumerLab testing update post-reformulation; target: ConsumerLab updated review showing "AG1 Next Gen: APPROVED" by Q3 2026
   - Expected impact: Remove the primary negative citation from LLM balanced responses; lift Brand Alignment score from 8.5/10 to 9.2/10

2. **Scientific Authority Deepening** — Achieve 8+ published peer-reviewed studies (from current 4); at least 2 fully independent (non-AG1 funded); register 1 ClinicalTrials.gov trial
   - Expected impact: Become the most scientifically documented greens powder in the category; create a citation moat that competitors cannot replicate for 3–5 years

3. **Entity Knowledge Graph Completion** — Achieve full Wikidata enrichment; Google Knowledge Panel with product entity; Schema.org implementation score of 9.0+/10
   - Expected impact: LLMs can answer "What is AG1?", "Who owns AG1?", "What does AG1 cost?", "Is AG1 certified?" from structured data without requiring retrieval augmentation

4. **Retail Presence → Review Volume** — Costco and Vitamin Shoppe distribution creates opportunity for Trustpilot/Amazon review flywheel as DTC subscribers encounter AG1 in new purchase contexts
   - Target: 25,000+ Trustpilot reviews at 4.0+/5 by December 2026

**Metrics to Track (60-day re-audit checkpoints):**

| Metric | Current | 90-Day Target | 12-Month Target |

| Trustpilot review count | 2,058 | 8,000+ | 25,000+ |
| PubMed studies | 4 | 5 | 8+ |
| AI visibility rate | 100% (brand-specific) | 100% (category) | 100% + sentiment improvement |
| Average AI ranking position | #1.3 | #1.1 | #1.0 (undisputed) |
| Overall AI Visibility Score | 8.1/10 | 8.6/10 | 9.2/10 |
